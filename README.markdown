## Pathable Coding Challenge

Hi, and thanks for playing! 

We challenge you to create a basic list implementation using Backbone.js and a portion our very own JS modeling framework (Backbone.Has). 

To play, please fork this repository, open up the index.html file in a browser and hack away. When you're done, commit your changes and issue a pull request. 

### Good luck!
